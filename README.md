# Kothabarta
It's a simple chatbot, with string manupulation. Here I take user inputs and according to the inputs the system will try to answer and the user has to answer the questions which are asked by the system. That's how it will be one to one conversation. To use the chatbot, just download my code and run it by any Java IDE.
